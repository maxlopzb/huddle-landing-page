## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Media queries
- Semantic HTML5
- Responsive images


### What I learned

I learned some new css-propiertes that i was not familiar with. For example: background-attachtment,etc. Also improve my knoweledge and understanding of flexbox and all of its properties. First time i make a webpage with so many changes based on the width of the viewport, so i was able to improve my skills on media queries. 


```css
footer {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
  margin-top: 125px;
}
```


### Continued development

I want to get better at Grid layout, flexbox and css in general. Also i want to start creating websites with functionality using javascript. Want to improve my UX/UI knowledge and have the abilty to creat desings and convert them into real websites.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - w3schools is an excellent resource when you feel stuck at something. I use it when i need to remember a concept.
